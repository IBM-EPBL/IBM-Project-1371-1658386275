# SmartFarmer - IoT Enabled Smart Farming Application

India is a Global agricultural powerhouse which is considered as the key for Human Progress. 
Farmers are usually involved in watering the crops at scheduled times which requires a lot of human intervention, 
they involve a high degree of guesswork and can be extremely wasteful.

We can use precision farming methodologies. 
They can make the decision whether to water the crop or postpone it 
by monitoring the sensor parameters and controlling the motor pumps from the mobile application itself.
Automation of watering crops reduces human intervention
